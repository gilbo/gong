Compiler Mini-Projects / Features

* add a simple builtin.t file with an assert builtin
* improve test coverage
* add "and" / "or" reduction operators
* add argmin/argmax functionality
* add argmin/max for list of top/bottom k (add a type...)

Looking at possible comparisons:

cloth_self_trimesh
  There's a squishy_ball dataset and other datasets I have code for
  This is probably what we want to do a lot of comparisons to "state-of-the-art" collision detection with.

planks
  Compare to Bullet directly

molecular dynamics
  (CHARM++?)
  Are there other systems implementing the same CHARM++ problem?

photon_kNN
  Library (slow) implementations: FLANN, nanoflann, libnabo
  http://research.nvidia.com/publication/toward-practical-real-time-photon-mapping-efficient-gpu-density-estimation
  ...?

points_in_tetgrid
  ...?

psaap_shadow
  I don't think there's a reference code to compare against

raycast_incoherent
  OptiX/Embree

sphere_uniform
  Compare to the yarn simulation work from Doug's group

Boolean Ops?
  (can compare to some code from a huge benchmark paper)


Assignments of Examples:
Gilbert
  Planks / Bullet
  Boolean Ops (Cork? Carve? LibIGL?)

Michael
  Charm++
  Optix / Rendering

Unassigned
  Cloth Self-collision / UNC Gamma http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/CAMA/cama.pdf (seems to tightly couple collission detection and resolution...)
  Point in Tetgrid?
  Sphere-Uniform
  PSAAP Shadow


Potential Other Examples:
  Volume Continuous Collision Detection (http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/volccd/paper.pdf)
