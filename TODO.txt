Looking at possible comparisons:

cloth_self_trimesh
  There's a squishy_ball dataset and other datasets I have code for
  This is probably what we want to do a lot of comparisons to "state-of-the-art" collision detection with.

planks
  Compare to Bullet directly

molecular dynamics
  (CHARM++?)
  Are there other systems implementing the same CHARM++ problem?

photon_kNN
  ...?

points_in_tetgrid
  ...?

psaap_shadow
  I don't think there's a reference code to compare against

raycast_incoherent
  Some other rendering systems?

sphere_uniform
  Compare to the yarn simulation work from Doug's group

Boolean Ops?
  (can compare to some code from a huge benchmark paper)
