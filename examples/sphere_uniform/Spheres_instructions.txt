Hey,

Sorry for the delay.
I have attached Spheres.zip.
Each text file is a new state of the time evolving system. (not necessarily the next time step)
Each text file has the format:
xval1
yval1
zval1
xval2
yval2
zval2
...

Each coordinate is on a new line, and each coordinate dimension is always x then y then z. All files have the same number of spheres, and are written in the same order I believe.

Hope this is useful. Let me know if you have any problems or need more data

Best,
Jonathan
